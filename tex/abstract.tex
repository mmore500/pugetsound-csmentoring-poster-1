Come join us for an hour-long group coding challenge and enjoy some snacks. During the challenge, a few (really rad) upperclassmen will be leading small teams (you!) to solve a fun programming puzzle drawn from the ICPC or Gayle Laakmann's Cracking the Coding Interview. This challenge, the first in a series planned for the semester, will help prepare you for a future technical interview or programming contest. Whether you are totally new to programming or have been around the block a few times, we want to see you there! We are looking forward to building social connections between new members of the CS department and older students.
